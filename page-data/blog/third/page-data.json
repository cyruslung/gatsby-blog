From there, hit Add webhook, and you will be directed to your new webhook. Then choose a name, put in the information of your HTTP endpoint (URL and authentication), specify any custom headers and select the types of events that should trigger the webhook.</p>\n<h2>Why do I get an old version in the CDA?</h2>\n<p>As the delivery API is powered by a CDN network consisting of hundreds of servers distributed across continents, it takes some time (up to a few minutes) to reflect the changes to the published content. This must be taken into consideration when reacting to webhooks. In normal conditions, there could be a reasonable delay of 2 to 5 minutes.</p>\n<p>Extracted from the <a href=\"https://www.contentful.com/faq/webhooks/\" title=\"Webhooks FAQ\">Webhooks FAQ</a>.</p>"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"third"}}}
